The ELF file 'hidden' was given

Using Ghidra, we found a few functions, and after some analyzing we found a function that seems to mimic a string append.
The key one was the Flag forming function, and after renaming a few functions for key functionality, and with help from AI, we got the flag.
FLAG: L3AK{b4by_sT3Ps}
