Butterfly fun fact website with the challenge description describing a hidden communication within the website.

Checking sources, there was a script being implemented from the cryptoJS library, although I couldn't quite find out on what it was being used.
Other than that there was nothing else suspicious within the sources.
Checking the other dev tools of the website showed that IndexedDB was being used as well as the session and local storage of the website.

The local storage contained the necessary code for decrypting the encoded string that one was supposed to find:
"CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(CIPHERTEXT, KEY).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)"

The session storage contained the passphrase key used by the AES encryption:
"secret key is very secure"

And the indexedDB entry containing an object named FLAG, depicting an 88 character string that looked like a hash (you had to put this one together manually):
"U2FsdGVkX19wWL7itIL7TZcLTP/e1ulrZolI9AHTA8OBGOCodbZKdOxPF41rGV9C+X7PZPt9ISJKQMPTl+Fwew=="

Putting this all together into an online node.js compiler with the code being: 
var CryptoJS = require("crypto-js");

console.log(
  CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(
    "U2FsdGVkX19wWL7itIL7TZcLTP/e1ulrZolI9AHTA8OBGOCodbZKdOxPF41rGV9C+X7PZPt9ISJKQMPTl+Fwew==",
    "secret key is very secure"
  ).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)
);

The output would be: 
TBTL{th15_1S_n0

which is in fact only half the flag. The other half I have yet to find
