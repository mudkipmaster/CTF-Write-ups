A Google cable lands here. What town does the other end of the cable land in?

The manhole cover next to the fiber optic cable has the letter vbda-comm which with a quick google search gives us
https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/googles-new-subsea-cable-between-the-u-s-and-europe-is-now-online/
which tells us that the cable ends up at Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez in France (subsea does make it kinda obvious)

The FLAG was just the town name, no flag formatting
