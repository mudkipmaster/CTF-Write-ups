Simple searching through a website for parts of the flag. 

The first one I found suspicious was the treasure link from the inspect element.
It hinted at robots leaving behind the rest of a flag, so searching robots.txt led me to find the rest of the flag. 

_t336e3}

From inspecting the first image of the shark we get the start of the flag:

bcactf{b3

the squid one gave the second part:

t_y0u_d1

the third was found in the clam website, with it being stored in the cookies (I'm just checking the responses im getting in Burp Suite):
dnt_f1n

part four was in the response header of shipwreck: 

d_th3_tr

part 5 from the whale subdir, again with burp suite:

e4sur3

All together now:

bcactf{b3t_y0u_d1dnt_f1nd_th3_tre4sur3_t336e3}
